# Simple-Bayesian-MetaAnalysis
After a brief introduction to meta-analysis, four different simple Bayesian hierarchical models are fitted to assess the impact of climate change on wheat yields.
The models are compared using standard statistical criteria. The robustness of the conclusion to the model assumptions is assessed.  

The dataset used here is from:
Zhao, C., Piao, S., Huang, Y. et al. Field warming experiments shed light on the wheat yield response to temperature in China. Nat Commun 7, 13530 (2016).
